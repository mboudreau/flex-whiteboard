1. create a directory 'closure' somewhere
2. get Closure Library and install it in 'closure/library'
    - svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ library
3. download Closure Compiler and unzip in 'closure/compiler'
    - http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
4. install Closure Linter into 'closure/linter'
    - https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto
5. get Closure Builder and install it in 'closure/builder'
    - svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/bin/build/ builder
6. edit 'build.properties' to reflect the location of the 'closure' directory
7. build FalconJS (see README)
8. run the publish script with the 'ant -Dapp.name=[your.app.name.here] -Dapp.location=[your.app.location.here]'

ATTENTION!
As of 2012-12-06, the FalconJS compiler doesn't output JS that can be parsed
by the new tool set. While this is being corrected, you'll have to create your
own 'intermediate' JS project, or modify one of the examples (I've included
'FlexJSTest_dummy' in the repo). Make sure to not include the 'falconJS'
dependency (?) in the build.xml and if you don't want to loose your work,
make sure to set CLEAN_INTERMEDIATE_JS to 'false' in build.properties.
